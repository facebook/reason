# Getting Started

Reason compiles to JavaScript and native code. The workflows for each are **currently separated**. This page describes the JavaScript workflow. Our native workflow is currently work-in-progress and can be seen [here](./nativeWorkflow.html).

Whenever you get stuck:

- Check out the [frequently asked questions](./faq.html).
- Peruse some [code examples](./examples.html).
- We're helping on [Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml)!

## Context

Reason can talk to JS and compile to it, thanks to [BuckleScript](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript), an optimizing compiler with first-class support for both Reason and vanilla OCaml syntax. We use the same standard library as OCaml, [documented here](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/).

For the JS workflow, we support both [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). Nothing else to learn!

**Note: the global editor tooling (Merlin, rtop) currently doesn't work well with Windows. The project setup & building, however, works well on all platforms**.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install -g bs-platform
bsb -init my-first-app -theme basic-reason
```

And then run it as usual:

```sh
cd my-first-app
npm run build
```

Alternatively, **to start a [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/gettingStarted.html) app**, try `bsb -init my-react-app -theme react`.

More info on bsb & bsconfig [here](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_bucklescript_build_system_code_bsb_code).

**BuckleScript has first-class support for Reason**, which is why you don't see any mention of "Reason" in the above step.


## Editor Setup & Global Utilities

See our [tooling](./tools.html) section for a descriptions of what you need to install and which editors we support.

Our [editor integration](./tools.html#editor-integration) need a few binaries to be found in your `$PATH`:

- `refmt`: the Reason parser/printer (editor formatter).
- `ocamlmerlin-reason`: Reason bridge to [Merlin](./tools.html#tools-command-line-utilities-merlin).
- `ocamlmerlin`: the Merlin binary.

The tooling section explains what these binaries do.

They can be installed globally through:

```sh
npm install -g git://github.com/reasonml/reason-cli.git#beta-v-1.13.6
## test that you have them installed correctly
which ocamlmerlin refmt ocamlmerlin-reason
```

**Note**: the global toolchain `reason-cli` currently doesn't work on Windows.

**Note**: please verify that your installed OCaml version is `4.02.x` and that Merlin is `>=2.5.1`. The above installation does that automatically, but people sometimes install our toolchain through other ways (e.g. native workflow, with looser version constraints).

```sh
ocamlc -version
ocamlmerlin -version
```

## Use & Publish Libraries

We host Reason/OCaml bindings to existing JavaScript libraries at [BuckleTypes](https://github.com/buckletypes). You can `npm install` them as you'd normally do in JavaScript. Likewise, `npm publish` to publish your Reason/BuckleScript library.

**As a gesture of courtesy**, you can publish the JS artifacts in `lib/js` for the pure JS consumers. Although you don't have to, we recommend [checking them into version control](http://facebook.github.io/reason/jsConversion.html#converting-your-javascript-to-reason-tips) in the near future, for debuggability. **Free output snapshots**!


## Talk to Existing JS Libraries

**Looking for Reason-React bindings**? [Here you go](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react)!

Redux implementation in Reason is at [Reductive](https://github.com/reasonml/reductive).

The [BuckleScript manual](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html) is all you need for calling JS from within BuckleScript. Here are some highlights:

- [Runtime representation](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_runtime_representation)
- [Binding to simple JS functions values](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_binding_to_simple_js_functions_values)
- [Create JS objects using `bs.obj`](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_create_js_objects_using_bs_obj)

## Convert JS to Reason

See [Conversion](./jsConversion.html).


## Use Native OCaml libraries

The JS workflow is currently npm/yarn-centric; to use a native OCaml package from OPAM, you'd need to fork it and put a [bsconfig.json](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_a_real_world_example_of_using_code_bsb_code) on it. Native libraries setups might be complex; it's recommended to use libs written with BuckleScript in mind instead.

# Native Workflow

Our native workflow is **work-in-progress**. See [here](./nativeWorkflow.html).
