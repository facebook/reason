* Description
This is a very basic layer for editing reason files.

** Features:
- Syntax highlighting (major-mode) via reason-mode local package.
- SOON: Error reporting, completion and type display via [[https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin][merlin]]
- auto-completion with company mode via [[https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin][merlin]]
- SOON: syntax-checking via [[https://github.com/diml/utop][flycheck-ocaml]]

* Install
** Layer
To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Make sure your local copy of Reason's editorSupport is searched for by emacs.
(setq-default
   dotspacemacs-configuration-layer-path '("/path/to/Reason/editorSupport/spacemacs/")
)
;; (Jadd reason to the dotspacemacs-configuration-layers list
;; that already exists in your .spacemacs file)
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(reason))

;; Restart emacs, open a .re file and you should see syntax highlighting
;; and autocomplete should work if your file has a close-by .merlin project.
#+END_SRC

** Plain Emacs without Spacemacs
You can also use the individual packages without using the spacemacs layer. Look at
pacakges.el to determine how to setup the individual packages.


** OPAM packages
This layer requires some [[http://opam.ocaml.org][opam]] packages:

- =merlin= for auto-completion
- =utop=

To install them, use the following command: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  opam install merlin utop
#+END_SRC

Make sure opam is initialized and configured.

#+begin_src sh
  opam init
  opam config setup -a
#+end_src
