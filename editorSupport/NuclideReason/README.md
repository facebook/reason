Supported Features
------------------

- __Auto Complete:__ Make sure your project has a .merlin file near the file you have open.

- __In-Editor Errors:__ Make sure your project has a `.merlin` file.

- __Code formatting:__ With Nuclide installed, either hit `cmd+shift_c`, or use the menu `Edit > Text > Format Code`

Installing
------------------

1. Make sure bleeding edge merlin `master` branch, and `Reason` installed via `OPAM`.
  ```sh
  opam switch 4.02.1
  opam pin add -y merlin https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin.git
  opam pin add -y reasonsyntax git@github.com:facebook/ReasonSyntax.git
  opam pin add -y reason git@github.com:facebook/Reason.git

  ```
2. Install `nuclide` from within Atom. (`Preferences` > `Install` > (search/install `nuclide`).
3. Install the plugins from within the `Reason` repo. Restart when finished:
```sh
# Install the basic syntax
cd Reason/editorSupport/language-reason
npm install
apm link
# Install the IDE integration
cd ../NuclideReason
npm install
apm link
```

4. Add this to your Atom config (accessible via the menu `Atom > Open Your Config`). Replace `{{yourname}}` with your login name. Also, confirm that those locations exist and are correct. Indentation matters!
```cson
"*":
  NuclideReason:
    merlinFlags: "-pp /Users/{{yourname}}/.opam/system/bin/reasonfmt_merlin"
    pathToMerlin: "/Users/{{yourname}}/.opam/system/bin/ocamlmerlin"
    pathToReasonfmt: "/Users/{{yourname}}/.opam/system/bin/reasonfmt"
```

5. Finally, open a `.re` file and select `Reason` as the current language.

Building and Adding Features
------------------
To build `NuclideReason`, you must have `js_of_ocaml` installed, in addition to `Reason`, and `ocamlmerlin`.
```sh
opam pin add -y js_of_ocaml https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml.git
cd NuclideReason
# Build the changes (npm install/apm link are only needed the first time)
npm install
npm start
apm link
```
